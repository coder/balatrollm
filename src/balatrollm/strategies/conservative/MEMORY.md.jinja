## Recent Decision History

Here is a list of your recent decisions (from oldest to newest):
{% set max_history = 10 if history|length > 10 else history|length %}
{% for entry in history[-max_history:] %}
**{{ loop.index }}.** `{{ entry.method }}({{ entry.params }})` - {{ entry.reasoning }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Strategic Context
{% if history %}
**Conservative Strategy Review:**
- Are you maintaining $25+ for maximum interest income?
- Are you avoiding unnecessary risks (Glass cards, selling jokers)?
- Is your joker order optimized (+Chips → +Mult → xMult)?
- Are you committed to one primary hand type?
- Have you avoided skipping blinds in early Antes?

Based on your recent actions, consider:
- How your decisions are building towards stable, consistent scoring
- Whether you're maintaining financial discipline
- If current joker synergies support your primary hand type
{% else %}
**Conservative Game Start - Key Priorities:**
1. Play every blind in Antes 1-3 for maximum cash
2. Build to $25 balance by end of Ante 2
3. Pick a primary hand type (Flush or Full House recommended)
4. Buy only reliable jokers that fit your strategy
5. Never sell jokers - the value loss is too high
6. Avoid Glass cards, risky Spectrals, and gambling mechanics

Focus on steady growth, not explosive plays.
